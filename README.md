JAVA CODE
The code had well written comments that explain what is happening at each stage
The first file uses arrays to store names and codes that are used to later match name and code when displaying greetings
The second file uses hashmaps to store code and name that is key and value, then later compare them against user input (using scanner ) and display greetings with the correct name as per the order of the key value stored
